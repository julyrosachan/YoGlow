                <h1>Nadi Shodhana Pranayama: The Ultimate Guide to Alternate Nostril Breathing</h1>
                <p><b>Nadi Shodhana Pranayama,</b> also known as Alternate Nostril Breathing, is a fundamental yogic
                    breathing technique designed to balance the body, calm the mind, and purify energy channels called
                    nadis. Practiced for centuries, it is revered for its ability to harmonize the nervous system and
                    prepare the mind for meditation.</p>
                <b>What is Nadi Shodhana Pranayama?</b>
                <p>The name comes from Sanskrit:</p>
                <p><b>Nadi</b>– means “channel” or “flow” of energy.</p>
                <p><b>Shodhana</b>– means “purification” or “cleansing.”</p>
                <p>Together, Nadi Shodhana means “purifying the energy channels”. Yogic philosophy highlights three main
                    nadis:</p>
                <p><b>Ida</b> (left, cooling energy)</p>
                <p><b>Pingala</b>(right, warming energy)</p>
                <p><b>Sushumna</b>(central, spiritual energy)</p>
                <p>Balancing these channels promotes mental clarity, emotional stability, and overall well-being.</p>
                <h2>Precautions</h2>
                <p>While generally safe, keep in mind:</p>
                <p>Avoid forcing your breath; it should always feel comfortable.</p>
                <p>Do not practice with a severely blocked nose or during acute illness.</p>
                <p>Stop immediately if you feel dizziness, heaviness, or discomfort.</p>
                <p>Consult a professional if you have heart, lung, blood pressure, or ear/eye issues.</p>

                <h2>Integrating Nadi Shodhana into Your Daily Yoga Routine</h2>
                <p>Ideal after yoga postures and before meditation.</p>
                <p>Daily practice, even for 5–10 minutes, is more effective than sporadic longer sessions.</p>
                <p>Regular practice helps maintain a calm mind, balanced energy, and improved focus throughout the day.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Nadi Shodhana Pranayama is more than just a breathing exercise—it’s a holistic practice that cleanses
                    your mind and body while promoting balance and inner peace. By dedicating a few minutes each day to
                    this simple yet powerful technique, you can experience improved focus, emotional stability, and
                    overall well-being.</p>

                <h2>Precautions</h2>
